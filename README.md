## ‚ú® **Latest Project Vision**

[‚ú® **Initial Project Vision**](https://github.com/innovinitylabs/shapecraft2/blob/main/MoodRingFlower_Project.md)

### üå∏ **Living Art Revolution**
Shapes of Mind represents a paradigm shift in NFT art - where each flower is not just a static image, but a living, breathing entity that evolves with your emotions and the collective mood of our community. Our flowers are powered by AI mood analysis and rendered in stunning 3D using Three.js, creating a truly unique and personal art experience.

### üß† **AI-Powered Emotional Intelligence**
- **Real-time Mood Analysis**: Advanced AI classifier that understands your emotional state from text
- **Dynamic Visual Evolution**: Flowers change color, shape, and animation based on your mood
- **Community Consciousness**: Flowers respond to collective community sentiment
- **Streak-Based Features**: Bee animations unlock with consistent positive moods

### üíé **Innovative NFT Economics**
- **Gas-Back Rewards**: 80% gas refunds on Shape L2 for user engagement, which will be used to subsidise mood updating, so there's less friction in using this as mood tracker
- **Dynamic Rarity**: A community-driven uniqueness system based on mood scores. There is no traditional rarity, since rarity often creates unnecessary stress among collectors. Instead, every artwork is unique, just as every human being is unique in their own way. Rarity is replaced by user streaks, which act as a leaderboard ‚Äî rewarding users for maintaining a positive mindset.
- **Living Metadata**: On-chain art that reads contract data for real-time updates (WIP)
- **Single Art Storage**: Efficient on-chain HTML art with versioning capabilities (or stored in transaction to reduce smartcontract bulk Considering using ZK in the future for privacy, have to do feasibility check)
- **Mood Journal**: Post mood update the user will get an image with what they wrote, their score and their flower snapshot which they can store as their mood journal. no data stored (except values on chain for streaks and animation) for privacy. (still brainstorming)

### üêù Bee mechanics in adherence with Ayurveda

1. Why Days Matter in Ayurveda and Mind Cycles
	-	Ayurveda often talks about ‚Äúdinacharya‚Äù (daily rhythm) and ‚Äúrutucharya‚Äù (seasonal rhythm).
	-	Transformation in body and mind is usually discussed in multiples of 3, 7, 14, and 21 days:
	-	3 days: First shift in manas (mind) is felt. Mood, sleep, and digestion show noticeable changes. Ayurveda says agni (digestive fire) can be influenced within this span.
	-	7 days (saptaha): A full cycle for subtle changes in the body‚Äôs tissues (dhatus) and mind. Often considered the minimum time to notice mental clarity or stability in positive habits.
	-	14 days (paksha): Half a lunar cycle. Mood and mental health in Ayurveda are deeply tied to the moon‚Äôs influence (chandra governs the mind). Two weeks of steadiness often mark deeper balance.
	-	21 days: Traditionally seen as a threshold for rewiring tendencies (modern psychology mirrors this with ‚Äúhabit formation‚Äù cycles). After this, a mental habit is considered stable.

2. Mapping That Onto Your Bee

The bee wont appear too easily (otherwise the act loses meaning) but also not be locked away behind impossible discipline.

	-	Minimum days for bee to appear (hover near flower): 3‚Äì7 days
	-	3 days: acknowledges immediate effort; encourages continuation.
	-	7 days: honors a saptaha cycle, deeper than a ‚Äújust tried a little.‚Äù
	-   14 days: symbolizes balance across a lunar phase. The mind stabilizes across waxing and waning energies. Bee Hovers a bit closer too center
	-	21 days: completion of a full transformation cycle, a truly strong mental victory. Bee sits on center of the flower.

(Optional idea)
	-	14 days = bee lands at the petal edges. (write mesh detection code)
	-	21 days = bee rests right at the center (bindu) of the flower, merging with the soul/essence.

## üí≠ **Developer Notes**

> **Integration Status**: Our web3 integration is currently experiencing some compatibility issues with Wagmi v2 API changes, but the core functionality is working. The beautiful 3D art system is fully functional and the smart contract is complete and tested. Despite the integration challenges, I'm incredibly proud of what we've built - this represents a revolutionary approach to NFT art with living, breathing flowers that respond to emotions and community sentiment. The hackathon has been an amazing experience and I feel like I've already won by creating something truly innovative. The project will be shipped soon with full functionality! üöÄ

#### Thanks üôèüèΩ
This project is fully vibe-coded, with just a tiny bit of manual code for the bees, crafted by ex-Civil Engineer turned artist VALIPOKKANN ( [X](https://x.com/VALIPOKKANN), [Site](valipokkann.in) ), who‚Äôs been in the NFT space since 2021. (The website design & demo slap, though üòé). from coming up with idea to an demo in less than 48 hours (started late because of wrong time zone conversion i did, then sidetracked to my main website project and then spent hours perfecting bee lol) enjoyed this whole process, the most alive i felt in 2025.
